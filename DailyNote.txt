- Install viber to config env

Why mock database?
- independent test: avoid conflicts with real data
- faster test:
    we don't need to talk to the database
    all actions will be performed in memory, on the same process
- 100% coverage
    easily setup edge cases: unexpected errors or connection lost
     
How: using stubs instead of fake db
    - fake db(implement a fake version of DB)

export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin

mockgen pathToModule/db/sqc InterfaceName
Example: mockgen -package mockdb -destination db/mock/store.go github.com/cs-tungthanh/Bank_Golang/db/sqlc Store                                               âœ” 13:19:03

transform this test into a table-driven test set
    to cover all possible scenarios of the GetAccountAPI to get 100% coverage
